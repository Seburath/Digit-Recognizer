import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense , Dropout , Lambda, Flatten
from keras.optimizers import Adam ,RMSprop
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras import  backend as K
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
# print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
